/**
 * <p>
 * Session represents userâ€™s subscription to a set of topics. This set is immutable, so new session should be
 * created if user wants to add/remove subscriptions to some topics.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Session does multiplexing for messages from several topics, so that only a single client connection is required to for data
 * transfer.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When session is created, it is getting unique UUID identifier, that client uses to communicate to that session.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When client is subscribed to a set of topics associated with some session, session fires SessionPreSubscriptionEvent, so that
 * application developer can control subscriptions according to access rights.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Session is kept alive for ({@link #getMaxInactiveInterval()}) minutes since the last time it has been accessed. Note that push can work in either polling (long
 * polling) and persistent connection (WebSocket) modes, so session should be kept-alive correctly in both cases.
