            Determines if tree node generated by model is leaf. Should contain EL expression which uses request-scoped
            variable with name defied in tree attribute 'var'.

        <description>
            EL expression pointing to nodes which should tree model iterate over. Implementation of java.util.Map or
            java.util.List. When map is provided, map keys are used as keys for the model, otherwise, keys are generated. (In
            case of treeModelRecursiveAdaptor, nodes are defined recursively, starting with roots and
            continuing with inner nodes. EL expression should then use request-scoped variable with name defied
            in tree attribute 'var' to point to
            inner nodes recursively and return null or empty map/collection for leafs.)
